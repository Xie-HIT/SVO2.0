# Benchmarking

We provide some infrastructure code in `svo_benchmarking` package to evaluate the pose estimation accuracy. 

The `svo_benchmarking` package allows to execute SVO (with/without VIO backend/global map) on multiple datasets at the same time. It also makes use of the [rpg_trajectory_evaluation]() package to evaluate the trajectory estimation accuracy conveniently. Please see the [README](../svo_benchmarking/README.md) in `svo_benchmarking` for details.
